<p><strong>The mans got appeal. pull Hansen, who turns 50 in imposing this year, rolls further to verbalize into the microphone, transfer the crowd into cheers. The crowd is as loud as any this Man in proposal heard at the ultimate of his around-the-world wheelchair tour 20 being ago.</strong> <font color='#FFFFFF'>本文来自织梦</font> </p>
<p><strong>while then, Hansen has done greatly to overcome incredible timidity and private frustration in order to challenge guilds perception of what is promising for superstar with spinal twine injury. He is an incredibly clear position sculpt.</strong> <p class='Hct541'>copyright dedecms</p> </p>
<p><strong>pull Hansen is not only an icon, he is a rightful hero, says Jordan, a grade 10 learner in Delta, BC, who heard Hansen verbalize lately. He showed me that something is promising.</strong> <div class='Hct541'>内容来自dedecms</div> </p>
<p><strong>As we take the journey through the final part of this article, you can look back at the first part if you need any clarifications on what we have already learned.</strong> <font color='#FFFFFF'>本文来自织梦</font> </p>
<p><strong>Hansen has led a time work to inspire us to think in the possibility of a quite accessible, inclusive guild and a therapy for spinal twine injury. As start of the pull Hansen Foundation, he has helped inflate awareness of the promise of people with disabilities, vanguard spinal twine examine, and established International Collaboration on darning Discoveries (ICORD), the prime spinal twine injury examine feature in the world. He has also established an yearly Wheels In proposal result, which has funded more than 500 feature-of-life projects to court. Life-Changing Moment</strong> <span class='Hct541'>copyright dedecms</span> </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s come a long way from Williams Lake and the injury in 1973 that left him paralyzed from the waist down&ndash;at age 15. Tossed from the box of an out-of-control pickup truck while hitchhiking, Hansen spent months in the Royal Columbian Hospital in New Westminster. This was followed by even more months in rehab at the GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre in Vancouver, where he began to accept the physical and emotional realities of his injury. It took a long time for Hansen to accept the wheelchair, though. <div class='Hct541'>dedecms.com</div> </p>
<p><strong>Road to Acceptance</strong> <div class='Hct541'>本文来自织梦</div> </p>
<p>Hansen used crutches and leg braces throughout most of his first year at university and while living in Haida House at the University of British Columbia&rsquo;s (UBC) Totem Park residence. As a student living in the same residence, I&rsquo;d see Hansen swinging his braced legs through the cafeteria, maneuvering his tray ahead of him in line, and then walking in that herky-jerky way of a man on prostheses towards a cafeteria table to join a group of friends&ndash;mostly girls, I noted. <font color='#FFFFFF'>dedecms.com</font> </p>
<p>It was only later that I realized the determination it took for Hansen to appear upright in braces and out of the wheelchair. &ldquo;The person wearing [leg braces] must be prepared to put in the work to lift and swing that essentially useless lower body forward,&rdquo; Hansen said. &ldquo;[Braces are] inconvenient in that you always have to have the crutches with you, and as a method of transportation they&rsquo;re nowhere near as fast or as efficient as a wheelchair. <p class='Hct541'>dedecms.com</p> </p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I could learn to use them, I could stand up. I could tackle stairs. I could look out at the world instead of up at it,&rdquo; Hansen said. &ldquo;For the first six months I hardly ever used my chair outside the gym. I&rsquo;d try to get between classes on my crutches and braces with a packsack on my back&ndash;10 minutes to go a mile, and me huffing and puffing down the road. The sensible thing would have been to wheel between buildings or classes with my crutches in my lap and leave the chair at the door. But in my mind, that would have heightened the perception of my being disabled.&rdquo; <span class='Hct541'>织梦好，好织梦</span> </p>
<p><strong>Road to Success</strong> <span class='Hct541'>内容来自dedecms</span> </p>
<p>Hansen&rsquo;s resistance to using a wheelchair relaxed the next year when he was accepted into the faculty of physical education at UBC, becoming the first student with a physical disability to graduate with a bachelor&rsquo;s of physical education from that university. <span class='Hct541'>copyright dedecms</span> </p>
<p>While in university Hansen began to compete internationally in wheelchair sports and went on to win 19 international wheelchair marathons, including three world championships. He competed for Canada at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. <p class='Hct541'>本文来自织梦</p> </p>
