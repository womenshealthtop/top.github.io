<p>What is often called â€œweight loss surgeryâ€?is usually an effective way of reducing your weight. It does so by physically reducing the size of your stomach. The effect is either to prevent you from eating large quantities or to limit the amount of food you can digest. When you look around at the literature and the marketing copy, there are a number of other names used depending on who is talking about it. The most common options are gastric banding, and bariatric and bypass surgery. Letâ€™s start off with a clear statement. Surgery should not be seen as the easy option. It should only be used when all other approaches have failed and your health is at risk, e.g. from heart disease. Why? Because there are risks associated with the surgery itself and complications can follow including blood clots, infections and hernias. In people who are merely overweight, the risks can be more serious than the benefits to be achieved. As a result, surgery is only recommended when you have not responded to the usual regimen of calorie-controlled diet, exercise and medication, and your health is at risk. Even then, surgery is often made conditional both on going through a course of counseling and agreeing to make significant lifestyle changes after surgery. The surgeons must be satisfied you are going to maintain a healthy approach to life and not simply carry on eating too much unhealthy food. Thus, you will meet with nutritionists to teach you how to eat a healthy diet and psychologists to assess whether you are likely to stick to the diet after surgery. As a test, many patients are told to lose a specific amount of weight as a condition to having the surgery. Who, then, qualifies for this surgery? The National Institutes of Health have issued guidelines recommending that it should be limited to two classes of patient: those who have a BMI of 40 and above; and those who have a BMI of between 35 and 40 with associated diseases or disorders including diabetes, heart disease and joint problems that restrict mobility. In other words, the aim of surgery is to reduce the risk of serious illness or premature death arising from the obesity. The majority who have the surgery are less prone to heart disease, cancer and the more serious depressive illnesses, but more prone to develop digestive disorders. As with all surgery, there are advantages and disadvantages to be balanced. It also means you will spend less on medication. As it stands, you may well buy phentermine which is the standard appetite suppressant. Phentermine is commonly used by those who find it difficult to diet and it works by reducing hunger pangs. The result is that people eat less when they feel less hungry. Additionally, you will find your general health improves, you will miss fewer days at work, there will be less discrimination and your quality of life will improve. Overall, you should have more dollars left in your pocket at the end of each month and find life more enjoyable. <div class='Fif322'>copyright dedecms</div> </p>
