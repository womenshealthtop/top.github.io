<P>when considering to buy a Jacuzzi there are many things to take into account. <font color='#FFFFFF'>内容来自dedecms</font> </P><P>For example one point when considering to purchase a Jacuzzi is that you need to ensure that you choose one with a proper good sound base one that can survive the extremes of the elements and not rot away with exposure to a combination of sun, heat or indeed water. <font color='#FFFFFF'>本文来自织梦</font> </P><P>At the same time the base of the Jacuzzi be resistant and impervious to any little horrors like mice or wood boring termites! <p class='Rqf779'>dedecms.com</p> </P><P>I have even heard of some cases involving cheap eastern imports with no floor where the wiring looms have been eaten through. They often have a steel frame but no bottom this can be somewhat dangerous as the wiring loom can be caught on the floor. <div class='Rqf779'>织梦内容管理系统</div> </P><P>We come across many second hand Hot Tubs where people update and change their Jacuzzis after some 7/10 years and as one would expect the better produced makes and models stand out head and shoulders above the rest. <font color='#FFFFFF'>本文来自织梦</font> </P><P>Those Jacuzzis with a Lower build quality show serious signs of wear and tear where the better built brands may often have many useful years life left in them and can in fact be refurbished and resold. <p class='Rqf779'>本文来自织梦</p> </P><P>A Jacuzzi needs to have sound and efficient insulation and should be designed so that the heat that naturally rises is retained automatically in the Spa. <p class='Rqf779'>copyright dedecms</p> </P><P>This way much of the heat that is generated from normal working of the Spa such as the pumps during routine filter cycles and that which is used to power the jets is contained within the spa cabinet so that it may be reused to passively heat the water and the Air which is introduced in to the Spa either via the Air or Water Jets. <div class='Rqf779'>dedecms.com</div> </P><P>This is I think a very good use of a finite resource. <span class='Rqf779'>内容来自dedecms</span> </P><P>It is a very good idea or indeed essential to ensure that the Jacuzzi that you purchase uses Branded Computer Controllers. This will ensure that spare parts are available if required. Unbranded controllers are impossible to service or repair due to the lack of parts. <div class='Rqf779'>织梦内容管理系统</div> </P><P>Recently we were asked to help a client with a Hot Tub which is made in china. The heater bears no resemblance to western systems and it was causing a complete short circuit. We took it to a specialist electrician who could not deal with it as despite various attempts he was just unable to source the parts. Are these cheap Chinese spas fit for purpose? No they are fit for the skip. <div class='Rqf779'>本文来自织梦</div> </P><P>As with many things in life it is always best to buy the highest quality that one can afford, from a top manufacturer who has been established for many decades as opposed to a cheap import no matter how clever it may be packaged. That very old but clever saying springs to mind that buying cheap can often mean that one ends up buying twice. <span class='Rqf779'>copyright dedecms</span> </P><P>So, my best advice is, that one should, only buy a product that is well built by an American or Western, internationally recognized, producer of Hot Tubs and then there is every chance that the product will last and last and give very many years of faultless performance. <p class='Rqf779'>内容来自dedecms</p> </P><P>The reason is simple the internationally recognized producer backs his products with a real guarantee, so if it has a fault it falls back on the manufacturer not on you. <p class='Rqf779'>copyright dedecms</p> </P><P>As you can imagine these manufacturers have had decades of experience and they build them with the proper parts and components so it will not fail and it is for that reason and that reason alone that they are prepared to provide a long life guarantee.<BR /> <span class='Rqf779'>内容来自dedecms</span> </P>
