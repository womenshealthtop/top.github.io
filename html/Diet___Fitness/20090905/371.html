Never has a conference been so overwhelmingly celebrated at the beginning of the season, and so completely dismissed at the end of the season as the Big Ten. Every year it seems as if Ohio State is just coming up short or Penn State is losing the big one. The mistake people make is in so vehemently disrespecting the conference once the national championship inevitably goes to someone else after weeks of anticipation that "this could be the year." <P /><P />Truth is this: the Big Ten is a quality football conference that perhaps receives too much attention and cannot possibly, and with consistency, live up to the pressure. No matter. Getting ready for the 2009 college football season, there are some great bets to be made, and these are the top three football picks from the Big Ten conference you should look out for: <P /><P />3. Michigan State: Last season, the Spartans logged nine wins and four losses. Running back Javon Ringer kept the Spartans in the conference title mix all season long until a late loss to rival Penn State dashed any and all hopes. Unfortunately for the Spartans, they are losing their quarterback Brian Hoyer and Ringer, but expectations are high for the talent pool coming up. Preseason Defensive Player of the Year Greg Jones makes up for a lot on the other side of the ball in the linebacker position. Look for this team to achieve better than expectations and to beat some teams they probably shouldn't.<P /><P />2. Ohio State: Coming off an impressive-by-most-team's standards 10-3 season, the Buckeyes were ultimately disappointed by their 2008-2009 performance ? hardly their first. On more than one occasion they have reached the title game only to flop big-time in front of a national audience. This troublesome history is the only thing keeping Ohio State from a vote of confidence to commandeer this season's Big Ten class. That, and they have effectively lost all their big guns: James Laurinitis, Malcolm Jenkins, Brian Robiske, and Chris Wells. That is not to say the Buckeyes don't have talent. They are simply in a "down year" position, and it will require some good old-fashioned "fighting off the ropes" moxie to rise to the top of the heap. <P /><P />1. Penn State: Penn State is coming off a Rose Bowl appearance and a victory over rival Ohio State. The Nittany Lions may have a young receiving corps, but they've got All Big Ten back Evan Royster to carry some of the load. Defensively, they return Sean Lee, a top caliber linebacker, to lead the defense. All it will take is the same tenacity they had last year to clinch the conference and perhaps land another BCS appearance. <P /><P />Whether you agree with these top three Big Ten football picks for the 2009 college football season or not, one thing is for certain: there is money to be made in college football betting. Before placing your bets on the season, however, keep in mind that you should select an established, reputable sportsbook. Watch for reputation, comments, and a bookmaker bonus. Many services that allow you to bet on your football picks will offer you a bookmaker bonus as a courtesy for using their service. A bookmaker bonus allows you to play longer with less risk, and you should take full advantage. <P /><P />So break out the piggybank and the foam #1 finger: football season is here again!<P />
