<p>When speaking about obesity we first have to understand what it means. Obesity is commonly regarded as an increased accumulation of fat in the body of an individual that poses danger to his or her health. There are many causes leading to obesity. However, one of the most common causes is the imbalance between calorie intake and use. In such cases weight loss specialists recommend sticking to a low calorie diet and employing an intense exercise program to restrict calorie over-consumption and burn the energy that is already stored in the body in the form of fat. Still, it may sound pretty easy on paper but n reality many obese people find it hard to follow such a regimen and their weight loss goals don't get as close as they wish to in a short time. A recent research headed by Nikhil Dhurandhar, who is an associate professor at the Infections and Obesity Laboratory, Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Louisiana State University has displayed that by simply eating eggs for breakfasts a person improves his or her chances of losing weight substantially and increases compliance. During the study it was observed that overweight and obese people who ate two eggs with their low calorie breakfast have shown much better improvements in weight loss compared to their peers who didn't take eggs for breakfast and were simply using a low calorie diet. To support the assumption, researchers have further compared overweight patients who ate egg breakfast to those who were on a regular bagel breakfast. As a result, those people who were following an egg diet have shown an average 5.8 pound weight loss during 8 weeks of the study. The average results in the â€œbagel breakfastâ€?group were a bit more modest â€?only 3.5 pounds over the same period. Simple math gave researchers the right to state that egg breakfast has showed a 65% improvement in weight loss rates compared to other low calorie types of meals. On top of that, people who were following the egg breakfast diet reported to be more energetic and active throughout the day, while the BMI in these patients had a 61% greater drop. To make the mentioned diet even more attractive it was found that egg breakfasts don't affect the lipid levels of the blood. Both the HDL and LDL cholesterol levels and triglycerides content test of the blood haven't shown any remarkable shifts to either side with low calorie diet breakfasts (both egg and bagel based). These findings advocate the use of eggs in overweight and obese patients without the risk of developing heart issues. Moreover, people on egg diet have reported to have a much greater feeling of satiety and less drive to consume more calories throughout the day as compared to those who weren't eating eggs. Either using a Phentermine based weight loss strategy or simple exercise program, eggs can really be helpful in shedding off those extra pounds. Eggs are high on protein content and give a feeling of satiety, which when paired with appetite suppressants like Phentermine can really be a substantial shift to a lower calorie intake and better improvements in weight loss. <div class='Haf509'>copyright dedecms</div> </p>
