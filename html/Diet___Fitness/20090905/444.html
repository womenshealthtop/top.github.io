Sir Bobby Robson, the former England manager from 1982 to 1990 sadly died on the 31st July 2009 at the age of 76, after a long battle with cancer, and it was this fighting spirit that he brought to his teams. Robson, first diagnosed with cancer 18 years ago, fought a brave battle against the disease, beating bowel cancer in 1992, a malignant melanoma in 1995 and in 2006 a tumour in his right lung and a brain tumour. In 2007 when he was diagnosed with cancer for the fifth time he vowed to "battle as I've always done" following the start of chemotherapy treatment.<P /><P />Robson was born the son of a miner in County Durham on the 18th February 1933. At the time of his death he was still involved with football, as honorary president of Ipswich Town, where he had made his name as a football manager, as well as being an ambassador for the Football Association of Ireland.<P /><P />He started his career with Fulham who he played with for 6 years, before venturing on to West Bromwich Albion in 1956, followed by Fulham in 1962. He played for England from 1958 to 1962 and in that time won 20 caps. He finished his playing career with the Vancouver Royals who he was with for a brief year both playing and coaching. He moved on to management with Oxford University whose team he was with for just a year, before changing to Fulham in January 1968, but was fired by Christmas of the same year. His next management involvement was with Ipswich, who he stayed with for 13 years, during which time the team won the FA Cup, the Uefa Cup and came runner up twice in the old First Division.<P /><P />When looking for the successor to Ron Greenwood as England manager there was what fans saw as a race between Robson and Nottingham Forest boss Brian Clough, but Robson pipped him to the post and he started in 1982. He will always be remembered for leading England to the 1990 World Cup semi-final, where they suffered a penalty shoot-out from West Germany. It must be acknowledged that he also got them to the 1986 World Cup quarter-finals, only to be beaten by Maradona's 'Hand of God' moment.<P /><P />His time as England manager saw the upturn in media interest in the role of the National manager role which led to some critical headlines during the low points of his career. This scrutiny continued on to Graham Taylor, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren.<P /><P />Robson endured a lot of probing during Italia 90 when it was disclosed that he was to leave the job to become coach of PSV Eindhoven. After PSV Eindhoven Robson went on to Sporting Lisbon, Porto and Barcelona, before he finally returned to his beloved Newcastle United in 1999. Robson was honoured with the erection of a statue at Portman Road and in 2002, after lengthy local newspaper campaigns in East Anglia and the north-east, was knighted for his services to football. And deservedly so.
