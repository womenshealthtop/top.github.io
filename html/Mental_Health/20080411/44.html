<p>The cultural criterion worn to be that it was sanction for men to swig, smoke, or eat to glut. Many did all of the above. Cultural weight barred men from pleasing an pastime in and accepting responsibility for their own strength. <div class='Mqm138'>内容来自dedecms</div> </p>
<p>Now it appears that, increasingly, men are pleasing responsibility for not only their own strength and form but also the strength and form of their families. Could it be that our customs has undergone, or is undergoing, a sea change? For supporting sign, lets look at my own behaviour. <span class='Mqm138'>织梦内容管理系统</span> </p>
<p>That was Then <p class='Mqm138'>织梦好，好织梦</p> </p>
<p>Keep reading further to learn how this topic can benefit you, as the rest of this article will supply you will the needed information. <p class='Mqm138'>织梦内容管理系统</p> </p>
<p>During the 1970s, I was in rate of a crew of two-fisted beer-swiging archaeologists. At noon every day we would protest to the bordering watering chasm, where we would belt back a beer (or three), bolt down burgers, and normally expend more money than we earned. The men on the crew did the same. (I forever had co-ed crews.) Later in the day, after fumbling through an morning of digging, we would replace to the watering chasm pending it congested. <span class='Mqm138'>织梦好，好织梦</span> </p>
<p>After a few days of this, I realized we were homicide our youth. I talked my crew into challenging archaeologists at a adjoining university to an exciting tough of broomball. That was in 1975, and we still play nowadays. More significantly, those of us who still play also smoothly go to the gym. The trust is we can play better, escape injury, and fend off the pitfalls of aging. <font color='#FFFFFF'>copyright dedecms</font> </p>
<p>In my Fathers DayI am now almost the age my father was when he died of heart failure. I work during the day, teach fitness classes in the evenings and on weekends, dig holes in archaeological sites on holidays, ski when it snows, and play broomball on Friday nights. Lounging at home in front of the television happens now and again, but somehow the channel always seems to be set to Home and Garden TV. And somehow every time I watch Home and Garden TV I end up with a hammer in my hand. <span class='Mqm138'>织梦好，好织梦</span> </p>
<p>I believe I can say that I have aged differently from my father. I brought up this topic during a conversation with friends after an exciting game of broomball at the watering hole where we now gather for a few post-game bottled waters (more on that later). My teammates said their fathers were still on the couch. One said that for him broomball was a weekly dose of good medicine. We agreed that we are all getting old, but we are aging differently from our fathers. <p class='Mqm138'>本文来自织梦</p> </p>
<p><strong>Men Making Changes</strong> <div class='Mqm138'>copyright dedecms</div> </p>
<p>Here are more observations: The Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute reports that more women than men are inactive; 66 percent of women are inactive compared to 60 percent of men. It&rsquo;s as if men secretly responded to the &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s-get-guys-off-the-couch&rdquo; campaign that has dominated the media over the past few decades.  <div class='Mqm138'>copyright dedecms</div> </p>
<p>Another change is afoot: In August 2005 Elaine Morgan in <em>New Scientist</em> reported that 445 fathers stayed at home with their children in the UK in 1986. Two decades later, that number has risen to more than 21,000 men. In fact, in June 2005, the UK&rsquo;s Equal Opportunities Commission announced that 79 percent of men questioned said they would be happy to look after their young children while their wife or partner went out to work. In a single generation, a behaviour that was once considered eccentric has become mainstream. <p class='Mqm138'>织梦好，好织梦</p> </p>
<p><strong>Men at Work</strong> <p class='Mqm138'>织梦好，好织梦</p> </p>
<p>Sometimes the demand for societal change of role stereotypes comes from our employers. Many companies today demand that men meet higher standards of health and fitness. This point is demonstrated in my occasional sessions teaching a fitness class at a local government job site. A perk for these government employees is free access to an on-site gym. The result is that, although women have always attended my classes there, now I see more men are working out, too.  <p class='Mqm138'>本文来自织梦</p> </p>
